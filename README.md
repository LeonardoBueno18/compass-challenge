# Compass Challenge

Welcome to the Compass Challenge! This challenge is designed to test your skills in Vue3.

## Project Overview

This project is a Vue3 application that provides an interactive form, enabling users to compose and send messages to Compass.

## Project Setup

You'll need Node.js version 18.10.0 for this project.

To install the necessary packages, run:

```bash
npm install
```

### Compilation and Hot-Reloading for Development

To compile the project and enable hot-reloading for development, run:

```bash
npm run serve
```

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to reload the page.

### Compilation and Minification for Production

To compile and minify the project for production, run:

```bash
npm run build
```

This command produces a dist folder with all the compiled and minified files, ready to be deployed to a production server.

## Usage

This application provides an intuitive user interface with an interactive form. To send a message to Compass, follow the steps below:

1. Locate the form on the main page of the application.
2. Fill in the required fields with the appropriate information.
3. Once you've filled out the form, click the 'Submit' button to send your message.
4. A confirmation message will appear to indicate that your message has been successfully sent.
